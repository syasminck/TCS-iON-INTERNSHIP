# TCS-iON-INTERNSHIP
In an increasingly data-driven world, business intelligence translates data into useful insights that help firms make better, more strategic decisions, improve operations, and achieve sustainable growth. This project provides insight into the ongoing effort to harness the power of data through the creation of analytics and reports using Data Science tools within the field of Human Resources (HR) analytics, with an emphasis on employee attrition and performances. Employee attrition analysis involves more than just figuring out why people quit their jobs; it involves strategically managing talent, enhancing workplace culture, and making data-driven decisions that have a positive effect on the effectiveness and success of the business as a whole.

The main objective of this project is,

a) To understand and analyze factors that lead to employee attrition.

b) To analyze factors affecting employee performance and means to optimize the same.

Employee performance management is important to optimize employee productivity and quality of delivery. Data Science and analytics with its plethora of tools and techniques allow us to gain insights regarding the same by analyzing relevant datasets. The key tool used to develop analytics and reports for this project is Microsoftâ€™s Power BI. Power BI provides a platform to compile, transform, and visualize data into meaningful insights. Power BI helps users to examine data from many perspectives using dynamic charts, graphs, and dashboards to find unnoticed patterns and relationships.

This project's primary goal is to understand the concepts of data analytics and the use of Power BI/Tableau. It aims to understand the factors affecting certain decisions and generate reports using different visualization and summarization techniques in Power BI.
